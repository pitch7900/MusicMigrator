A Guzzle middleware that can throttle requests according to (multiple) defined rules. 

It is also possible to define a caching strategy, 
e.g. get the response from cache when the rate limit is exceeded or always get a cached value to spare your rate limits.

Using [wildcards](#wildcards) in host names is also supported.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require hamburgscleanest/guzzle-advanced-throttle
```

## Usage

### General use

Let's say you wanted to implement the following rules:

> **20** requests every **1 seconds**
>
> **100** requests every **2 minutes**


----------


1. First you have to define the rules in a `hamburgscleanest\GuzzleAdvancedThrottle\RequestLimitRuleset`:

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset([
        'https://www.google.com' => [
            [
                'max_requests'     => 20,
                'request_interval' => 1
            ],
            [
                'max_requests'     => 100,
                'request_interval' => 120
            ]
        ]
    ]);
```

Make sure the host name does not end with a trailing slash. It should
be `https://www.google.com` not `https://www.google.com/`.

----------


2. Your handler stack might look like this:
``` php
 $stack = new HandlerStack();
 $stack->setHandler(new CurlHandler());
```


----------
3. Push `hamburgscleanest\GuzzleAdvancedThrottle\Middleware\ThrottleMiddleware` to the stack. 

> It should always be the first middleware on the stack.

``` php
 $throttle = new ThrottleMiddleware($rules);

 // Invoke the middleware
 $stack->push($throttle());
 
 // OR: alternatively call the handle method directly
 $stack->push($throttle->handle());
```
----------
5. Pass the stack to the client
``` php
$client = new Client(['base_uri' => 'https://www.google.com', 'handler' => $stack]);
```

Either the `base_uri` has to be the same as the defined host in the rules array or you have to request absolute URLs for the middleware to have an effect.

``` php
// relative
$response = $client->get('test');

// absolute
$response = $client->get('https://www.google.com/test');
```

----------

### Caching

----------

#### Beforehand

Responses with an error status code `4xx` or `5xx` will not be cached (even with `force-cache` enabled)! 

----------

#### Available storage adapters

##### `array` (default)

Works out of the box. However it `does not persist` anything. 
This one will only work within the same scope.
It's set as a default because it doesn't need extra configuration.

The recommended adapter is the `laravel` one.

----------

##### `laravel` (Illuminate/Cache) - *recommended*

You need to provide a config (`Illuminate\Config\Repository`) for this adapter.

----------

##### `custom` (Implements `hamburgscleanest\GuzzleAdvancedThrottle\Cache\Interfaces\StorageInterface`)

When you create a new implementation, pass the class name to the `RequestLimitRuleset::create` method. 
You'll also need to implement any sort of configuration parsing your instance needs.
Please see `LaravelAdapter` for an example.

###### Usage:
``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'force-cache', // caching strategy
    MyCustomAdapter::class // storage adapter
    );
    
$throttle = new ThrottleMiddleware($rules);

// Invoke the middleware
$stack->push($throttle());  
```

----------

#### Laravel Drivers

##### General settings

These values can be set for every adapter.

``` php
    'cache' => [
        'ttl' => 900, // How long should responses be cached for (in seconds)?
        'allow_empty' => true // When this is set to false, empty responses won't be cached.
    ]
```

----------

##### File

``` php
    'cache' => [
        'driver'  => 'file',
        'options' => [
            'path' => './cache'
        ],
        ...
    ]
```

----------

##### Redis

``` php
    'cache' => [
        'driver'  => 'redis',
        'options' => [
            'database' => [
                'cluster' => false,
                'default' => [
                    'host'     => '127.0.0.1',
                    'port'     => 6379,
                    'database' => 0,
                ],
            ]
        ],
        ...
    ]
```

----------

##### Memcached

``` php
    'cache' => [
        'driver'  => 'memcached',
        'options' => [
            'servers' => [
                [
                    'host'   => '127.0.0.1',
                    'port'   => 11211,
                    'weight' => 100,
                ],
            ]
        ],
        ...
    ]
```

----------

###### Pass the config repository in the constructor of RequestLimitRuleset

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'cache', // caching strategy
    'laravel', // storage adapter
    new Repository(require '../config/laravel-guzzle-limiter.php') // config repository
    );
```

----------

> The same adapter will be used to store the internal request timers.

----------

##### The adapters can be defined in the rule set.

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'cache', // caching strategy
    'array' // storage adapter
    );
```

----------

#### Without caching - `no-cache`

Just throttle the requests. No caching is done. When the limit is exceeded, a `429 - Too Many Requests` exception will be thrown.

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'no-cache', // caching strategy
    'array' // storage adapter
    );
```

----------

#### With caching (default) - `cache`

Use cached responses when your defined rate limit is exceeded. The middleware will try to fallback to a cached response before throwing `429 - Too Many Requests`.

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'cache', // caching strategy
    'array' // storage adapter
    );
```

----------

#### With forced caching - `force-cache`

Always use cached responses when available to spare your rate limits. 
As long as there is a response in cache for the current request it will return the cached response. 
It will only actually send the request when it is not cached. 
If there is no cached response and the request limits are exceeded, it will throw `429 - Too Many Requests`.

> You might want to disable the caching of empty responses with this option (see [General Driver Settings](https://github.com/hamburgscleanest/guzzle-advanced-throttle#laravel-drivers)).

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset(
    [ ... ], 
    'force-cache', // caching strategy
    'array' // storage adapter
    );
```

----------

#### Custom caching strategy

Your custom caching strategy must implement `CacheStrategy`.
It is suggested you use `Cacheable` for a parent class.
This will give a good head start, see `ForceCache` and `Cache` for ideas.

To use your custom caching strategy, you'll need to pass the fully qualified cache name to `RequestLimitRuleset`.

##### Usage
```php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset([ ... ], 
                                MyCustomCacheStrategy::class, 
                                'array', 
                                new Repository(...));
                                
$throttle = new ThrottleMiddleware($rules);
...                                
```


----------

### Wildcards

If you want to define the same rules for multiple different hosts, you can use wildcards.
A possible use case can be subdomains:

``` php
$rules = new RequestLimitRuleset([
        'https://www.{subdomain}.mysite.com' => [
            [
                'max_requests'     => 50,
                'request_interval' => 2
            ]
        ]
    ]);
```

This `host` will match `https://www.en.mysite.com`, `https://www.de.mysite.com`, `https://www.fr.mysite.com`, etc.
